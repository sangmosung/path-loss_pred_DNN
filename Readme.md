# DNN model for path loss prediction v1.1 2022-06-13

This deep neural network model is designed to predict the path loss of Vehicle Communication, 
and the dataset required for model learning is obtained through the ns3-SUMO integrated simulation testbed*.
DNN model use the most common Deep Neural Networks model to predict path loss.
Each model is implemented in the form of a Jupiter notebook ipynb file, and CNN and LSTM versions are currently being updated.
Users can change most DNN model parameters, but care must be taken when changing data fields.
